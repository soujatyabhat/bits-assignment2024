    <h3> <u> Web Servers  </u></h3> <br>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="point"> Hardware and Software: </span> A web server can refer to either a computer (hardware) that stores web server software and a websiteâ€™s component files, or the software that serves these files over the internet. </li> <br>
        <li> <span class="point"> HTTP Protocol: </span> Web servers operate on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. </li> <br>
        <li> <span class="point"> File Delivery: </span> When a browser requests a file hosted on a web server, the server finds the requested document and sends it back to the browser through HTTP. </li> <br>
        <li> <span class="point"> Static and Dynamic: </span> There are static web servers that send hosted files as-is to your browser, and dynamic web servers that update the hosted files before sending content to your browser via the HTTP server. </li> <br>
        <li> <span class="point"> High Availability: </span> In a multi-tier web server architecture, multiple servers are used to distribute the workload and ensure high availability. This often involves load balancers that evenly distribute incoming requests across a cluster of web servers. </li> <br>
    </ul>
